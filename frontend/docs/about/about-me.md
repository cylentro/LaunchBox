## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Christian, a Senior Product Manager with 7+ years of dedicated PM experience, built on a solid foundation of 10 years in the logistics industry. My ongoing mission? To make logistics less, well, "logistical" and more logical (and user-friendly!). My latest obsession? Figuring out how [Generative AI](/gaillery/prompt-frameworks) can sprinkle some magic on everything. In fact, I've just launched a comprehensive new course, [Prompting 101: The Playbook for Everyone](/gaillery/prompting-101/introduction), to help others master the art of communicating with AI!

My origin story isn't your typical PM tale. I started as a Full-Stack Developer at **[Moonlay Technologies](https://moonlay.com/)** ‚Äì think of it as a tech bootcamp where I got to wear all the hats: coder, analyst, bug-hunter, client-charmer, and project-wrangler. It was a wild ride building cool stuff for diverse clients. This multi-faceted start taught me to speak fluent "dev" and "business" ‚Äì a handy skill in the product world!

Next, I jumped into the product deep-end at **[Red Carpet Logistics/QRIM Express](https://www.instagram.com/qrimexpress/)**, focusing on making internal tools less soul-crushing and helping the company conquer the retail frontier. Then, **[Anteraja](https://anteraja.id/en/)** called. I began as the go-to guy for customer onboarding, making friends with e-commerce giants like Tokopedia and Shopee, and even cooking up special projects with Soekarno-Hatta Airport and Unilever (yes, the Rinso folks!). Now, I'm a Senior PM there, looking after our customer mobile app, business portal, shipping insurance (exciting, I know!), and the all-powerful promo engine. As a side quest, I'm currently teaming up with KedaiMart to level-up their app's customer experience.

**So, What Do I Do When I'm Not Herding Pixels?**

You know how some people need a "social media detox"? I'm the opposite. I need a detox from not being on social media... just kidding, I genuinely don't get the hype. My path to Zen involves slightly more analog, and admittedly random, pursuits:

* Paracord Weaving: Turning string into surprisingly cool bracelets. It's like coding, but with knots.
* Rubik's Cubes: Because solving colorful, twisty puzzles is my kind of fun.
* Calligraphy: Making letters look fancy. It's the OG font design.
* Gaming: Because sometimes, virtual worlds are more fun than the real one.
* Mandala Drawing: Getting lost in symmetrical patterns. Cheaper than therapy.
* Marketplace Scrolling: My one true digital vice. It's not social media, it's research. Yeah, let's go with that.

Throw in some Netflix binges, YouTube deep-dives, and a healthy appreciation for good tunes (my audio gear collection is my pride and joy), and that's me in a nutshell.

So, that's a bit about me! A product enthusiast by trade, a curious creator by nature, and always up for a good challenge (or a good tune).
