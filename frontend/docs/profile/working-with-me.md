# Working with Christian: The Playbook

So, you're curious about what it's like to have me on your team? Let's skip the corporate jargon. Here’s the real deal on how I operate, collaborate, and solve problems.

## The First Move: Embracing the Chaos

My comfort zone is right in the middle of ambiguity. When a new project arrives—especially one that's a bit unclear or challenging—I dive in headfirst to bring clarity. My first instinct is to map out the situation, understand the constraints, and define what needs to be done to get from A to B.

A real-world example? I was once tasked with replacing a critical third-party promo engine with an an internal solution. The catch? The previous PM had resigned, the contract was ending in two months, and our team was smaller than ever. My approach was to immediately:

1. Understand the Product: Get up to speed on a system I knew nothing about and define a realistic MVP.
2. Rally the Team: Huddle with the developers to create a tight, achievable plan.
3. Manage the Transition: Work with the outgoing vendor to ensure a smooth handover.

I thrive on turning messy situations into structured plans and bringing the team along for the ride.

## Communication Style: Direct, Fast, and... Annoying?

Let's be honest: my chat style might take some getting used to. I'm a fan of quick, rapid-fire messages with lots of `Enter` key hits. Some might call it annoying at first, but it's just how my brain works—fast and direct.

I value clear and open communication. While I might sometimes jump into a discussion without providing all the context upfront (I get excited!), I'm committed to filling in the gaps as we talk. If you need more detail, just ask!

Under pressure, I keep the lines of communication wide open. When the team is facing a tight deadline, I’m right there in the trenches with them, ensuring they have the support they need and that no one is left behind.

## My Role on the Team: The Devil's Advocate & Part-Time Leader

I've been described as a "part-time leader and full-time devil's advocate."

I naturally step up to lead when a situation requires direction and no one else is taking the reins. However, my most consistent role is to challenge our assumptions. I'm the one who asks "Why?" and "What if?" to ensure we're not just following the path of least resistance but are building the best possible solution. It's easy for me to play the "bad cop" in this scenario, but I find it harder to be the "good cop." While I value and create plans, my strength is being an executor and navigator—I'm good at guiding the conversation and pushing the team (gently, I promise!) toward our shared goal.

### On Feedback, Disagreements, and Great Teams

* Feedback is a Gift: I genuinely believe all feedback, good or bad, is valuable. Good feedback tells me what's working and should be maintained. Critical feedback is a learning opportunity. I prefer giving and receiving it directly and casually, with a strong dose of empathy—think Radical Candor. My 1-on-1s are often just casual chats over coffee.
* Conflict is About Perspective: Disagreements usually happen because we're looking at a problem from different angles. My method is to get all the facts and viewpoints on the table, break down big problems into smaller, digestible pieces, and use active listening to make sure everyone feels heard. From there, we find the solution together.
* The Best Teams Run on Trust: For me, ideal teamwork boils down to three things: a real human connection, a shared direction, and unwavering trust. The best collaborations happen when you trust your teammates to do their jobs brilliantly, with or without your direct oversight. It’s about building relationships and believing in each other's skills.

### Problem-Solving & The Personal Touch

* Getting Unstuck: When I hit a wall, my first step is to refresh—a short walk or doing something completely random usually does the trick. If the problem persists, I'll start a casual chat with a colleague to get a fresh perspective or scour the internet for new approaches.
* Failure is Learning: I love a good challenge, and working in startups means embracing change and setbacks. I see failure as a powerful tool for learning and a valuable teaching moment for the whole team.
* My "Off-Resume" Superpowers: Colleagues would probably say I'm the one who's "always working." I also have a knack for seeing patterns or details that others might miss. But my most valuable superpower? The ability to learn and adapt, fast.
* A Good Workday Is...: Simple, really. A day where I solve a tricky problem or help someone else solve theirs. (And yes, a day with no meetings is a pretty great day too!)
* Currently Nerding Out On: You guessed it—AI!
