# The Architect's Cheat Sheet: Vibe Coding

A quick reference guide to the core concepts, workflows, and frameworks from the "Vibe Coding: Building Apps with AI Conversation" course. Keep this handy to turn your ideas into reality.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Architect & Builder

Your role and the AI's role in the creative process.

*   **You are the Architect:** You hold the vision, the blueprint, and the "vibe." Your job is to communicate the *what* and the *why*.
*   **The AI is the Builder:** Your brilliant, fast construction crew. Its job is to execute the *how* based on your clear instructions.

> **Remember:** Your most valuable skill is clear communication, not writing perfect code.

## 2. The 5-Step Iterative Workflow

The safest and most effective way to build. **Never ask for the whole app at once.**

1.  **Define the Goal (The "Vibe"):** State your objective in one clear sentence.
2.  **Break it Down (The Blueprint):** List the smallest, most essential visual components (MVP).
3.  **Prompt Iteratively (The Build):** Ask the AI to build *one tiny piece at a time*.
4.  **Assemble & Test (The Inspection):** Put the code into a test environment (like CodePen) and see if it works as expected.
5.  **Refine with Feedback (The Revision):** Continue the conversation with your AI, asking for changes or the next piece.

## 3. The Architect's Prompt Framework

The single most important skill for getting high-quality results from your AI partner.

**Formula:** `[Persona] + [Task] + [Context & Constraints] + [Output Format]`

*   **Persona:** "Act as an expert web developer specializing in accessible UI."
*   **Task:** "Write the HTML for a user signup form."
*   **Context & Constraints:** "This is for a gardening app. It must include fields for email and username. Do not use any JavaScript yet."
*   **Output Format:** "Provide the complete HTML in a single, formatted code block with comments."

## 4. The AI Debugging Workflow

When things go wrong, follow this process.

1.  **Reproduce the Bug:** What specific action causes the error?
2.  **Check the Console:** Open Browser Dev Tools (`Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Shift + J`) and look for red error messages.
3.  **Copy the Evidence:** Copy the *exact* error message.
4.  **Talk to Your AI:** Use the debugging prompt framework below.

### The Perfect Debugging Prompt

**Formula:** `[Context] + [Problem] + [Error Message] + [Code] + [Question]`

> **Remember:** Always ask the AI to *explain the fix*, not just provide it. This turns every bug into a learning opportunity.

## 5. The House Analogy: Core Tech Concepts

*   **HTML (The Skeleton):** Provides the fundamental structure and content.
*   **CSS (The Interior Design):** Controls the visual presentation, look, and feel.
*   **JavaScript (The Plumbing & Electricity):** Adds interactivity and functionality, making the app *do* things.
