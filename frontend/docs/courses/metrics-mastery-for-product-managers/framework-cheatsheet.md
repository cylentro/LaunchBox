## The Integrated System: A Doctor's Analogy

The frameworks are not separate tools; they are a nested system for diagnosing and solving problems.

* **North Star:** The patient's long-term health goal (e.g., "Lower cholesterol"). It's the ultimate outcome.
* **AARRR:** The annual physical exam. It's a broad diagnostic that identifies the general problem area (e.g., "Your blood pressure is high"). It tells you **where** to look.
* **HEART:** The specialized diagnostic tool (e.g., an EKG). Once you know the problem, you use HEART to understand the specific **why** and guide the solution.

## 1. The North Star Framework
