# Metrics 4: Frameworks for the Funnel and User Experience

While the North Star Framework provides the high-level strategic direction, product leaders need more granular, tactical frameworks to diagnose specific problems and guide day-to-day improvements. This section explores two of the most powerful tactical frameworks—AARRR and HEART—and, most importantly, provides a unified model for how they work together with the North Star to create a comprehensive measurement system.

## The AARRR "Pirate" Metrics Framework

Developed by investor Dave McClure, the AARRR framework, often called "Pirate Metrics," is a simple yet powerful model for understanding and optimizing the customer lifecycle. It breaks the user journey down into five distinct, measurable stages, creating a funnel that allows teams to pinpoint where users are dropping off and focus their efforts on the biggest opportunities for growth.

### Overview of the Five Stages

AARRR is an acronym for Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. It maps the journey from a user first discovering a product to becoming a loyal, paying customer.

### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown with Advanced Metrics

For the framework to be effective, product teams must define specific, meaningful metrics for each stage.

#### Acquisition

How do users find you?This stage covers all the channels through which potential customers discover the product. The goal is not just to drive traffic, but to attract the right kind of traffic that is likely to convert.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Traffic by Channel:** Understanding which channels (e.g., organic search, paid ads, social media) are driving the most visitors.
* **Visitor-to-Lead Conversion Rate:** The percentage of visitors who take an initial action, like signing up for a newsletter or a webinar.
* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** The total cost to acquire a new customer, calculated per channel to understand marketing efficiency.

#### Activation

Do users have a great first experience?This is arguably the most critical stage for product-led growth. Activation is not merely a sign-up; it is the moment a user experiences the product's core value for the first time—the "Aha!" moment. For Facebook, this was when a user added 7 friends in 10 days. For a B2B SaaS tool, it might be when a user invites a teammate or completes their first project setup.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Activation Rate:** The percentage of new users who complete a predefined key action (the "Aha!" moment) within a specific timeframe.
* **Time to Value (TTV):** The average time it takes for a new user to reach the activation milestone. Reducing TTV is a primary goal of onboarding optimization.
* **Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate:** For freemium or trial-based models, this is a strong indicator that users have experienced sufficient value to make a financial commitment.

#### Retention

Do users come back?Acquiring users is expensive; retaining them is where sustainable growth happens. This stage measures the ability of the product to create lasting value that encourages repeat usage.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Retention Rate / Churn Rate:** The percentage of users who continue to use the product over a specific period (e.g., week-over-week, month-over-month). Churn is the inverse of retention.
* **DAU/MAU Stickiness Ratio:** The ratio of Daily Active Users to Monthly Active Users. A higher ratio indicates that a larger portion of your user base is engaging with the product on a daily basis, signaling a "stickier" product.
* **Session Interval:** The average time between user sessions. A decreasing interval can signal increasing engagement.

#### Referral

Do users tell others?This stage measures the extent to which satisfied customers become advocates for the product, driving organic, word-of-mouth growth.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** A survey-based metric that measures a user's willingness to recommend the product.
* **Viral Coefficient (K-Factor):** The number of new users that each existing user generates. It is calculated as the number of invites sent per user multiplied by the conversion rate of those invites. A K-factor greater than 1 indicates exponential viral growth.
* **Referral Conversion Rate:** The percentage of referred users who successfully sign up or activate.

#### Revenue

How do you make money?This is the ultimate stage where user value is converted into business value.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV):** The total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account over their lifetime with the product.
* **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** The predictable, recurring revenue a subscription business expects to receive each month.
* **Expansion MRR:** Additional MRR generated from existing customers through upgrades, add-ons, or cross-sells. This is a key indicator of a healthy B2B SaaS business.
* **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** The average revenue generated per user, which helps in understanding the monetization efficiency of the user base.

The primary application of the AARRR framework is as a diagnostic tool. By measuring the conversion rates between each stage of the funnel, product teams can identify the biggest "leak"—the point where the most users are dropping off. This allows them to focus their limited resources on the part of the customer journey with the highest potential for impact.

::: tip Pro-Tip: Find Your "Aha!" Moment with Data
Defining the "Activation" event is critical but often based on guesswork. To make it data-informed, run a correlation analysis. Look at all the actions new users take in their first 7 days (e.g., invite a teammate, create a project, upload a file). Then, see which of those actions has the highest correlation with long-term retention (e.g., 90-day retention). The action that is most predictive of retention is your true, data-validated "Aha!" moment.

## Google's HEART Framework

While AARRR provides a macro view of the customer journey, Google's HEART framework offers a micro view, focusing specifically on the quality of the user experience (UX). Developed by Google's UX research team, HEART provides a structured way to measure user-centric aspects of a product that are often difficult to quantify.

### Overview of the Five Categories

HEART is an acronym for five categories that together provide a holistic picture of UX quality: Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success. Unlike AARRR's linear funnel, HEART is a constellation of metrics that can be applied to an entire product or a single feature.

### The Goals-Signals-Metrics Process

The core of implementing the HEART framework is the **Goals-Signals-Metrics (GSM)** process. This process ensures that teams measure what truly matters by connecting high-level objectives to specific, quantifiable metrics.

1. **Goals:** The process begins with defining high-level goals for the user experience. What does the team want to achieve for the user? This should be an outcome, not an output (e.g., "Help users feel confident in their purchase decisions" is a goal; "add a reviews feature" is an output).
2. **Signals:** For each goal, the team brainstorms user behaviors or attitudes that would act as signals of success or failure. These are observable indicators that the goal is being met.
3. **Metrics:** Finally, the signals are translated into specific, quantifiable metrics that can be tracked over time. These metrics are the concrete numbers that will be monitored on dashboards and used in A/B tests.

### HEART Categories with Granular Examples (using the GSM process)

#### Happiness

How do users feel about the product?This category is attitudinal, measuring user satisfaction and perception.

* **Goal:** Users find the app easy and enjoyable to use.
* **Signals:** High ratings in app stores, positive survey responses, users recommending the product.
* **Metrics:** Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), 5-star rating percentage, survey-based System Usability Scale (SUS) or ease-of-use score.

#### Engagement

How deeply are users involved with the product?This category is behavioral, measuring the frequency, intensity, or depth of interaction.

* **Goal:** Users are deeply interacting with the core collaborative features.
* **Signals:** Users frequently create and share documents, leave comments for teammates, and spend significant time in the collaborative workspace.
* **Metrics:** Number of documents shared per user per week, average number of comments per document, average session duration in the collaborative feature.

#### Adoption

Are new users discovering and using the product/feature?This category focuses on the uptake of a product or a new feature by new users.

* **Goal:** New users quickly discover and use the new "Project Templates" feature.
* **Signals:** New users click on the templates button, apply a template, and successfully create a project from it.
* **Metrics:** Percentage of new users who use the templates feature within their first 7 days, conversion rate from template view to template application.

#### Retention

Are existing users coming back?This category measures long-term engagement for the existing user base.

* **Goal:** Users continue to find the product valuable for managing their weekly tasks.
* **Signals:** Users who were active last week are also active this week; subscription renewal rates are high.
* **Metrics:** Week-over-week cohort retention rate, customer churn rate.

#### Task Success

Can users achieve their goals effectively and efficiently?This category measures the core usability of task-oriented flows.

* **Goal:** Users can complete the multi-step checkout process quickly and without errors.
* **Signals:** High rate of successful checkouts, low number of rage clicks or errors on the payment page, short time spent in the checkout flow.
* **Metrics:** Task completion rate (%), average time-on-task, user error rate (%).

::: tip Pro-Tip: Don't Boil the Ocean—Focus Your HEART
Trying to improve all five HEART categories at once leads to scattered effort and minimal impact. Instead, pick one or two categories that are most relevant to your current strategic goals for a given quarter or initiative. If your goal is to improve a complex, task-oriented feature, focus intensely on **Task Success** and **Happiness**. If you're trying to drive deeper product usage, focus on **Engagement**. This concentrated effort is far more likely to produce meaningful change.

## Synthesizing the Frameworks into a Unified System

Product leaders are often faced with a dizzying array of frameworks, leading to confusion about which one to use and when. The key is to understand that the North Star, AARRR, and HEART frameworks are not competing philosophies but complementary tools that operate at different levels of abstraction. When integrated, they form a powerful, cohesive system for driving product growth.

The confusion many product managers face stems from viewing these frameworks as mutually exclusive options. The most effective approach is to see them as a nested system, a hierarchy of measurement that connects the highest-level company strategy to the most granular user interaction. This integrated system allows a product leader to diagnose problems at the right level and apply the appropriate tool to solve them.

### The Hierarchy of Measurement: A Three-Layered Approach

A unified system can be visualized as a three-layered pyramid, moving from the strategic to the tactical.

#### The Strategy Layer (The "What"): The North Star Framework

At the apex of the pyramid is the North Star Framework. It answers the fundamental question: "What is our ultimate product goal?" The NSM and its metric tree define the organization's long-term vision of success in measurable terms. It sets the destination and outlines the main levers (the input metrics) that the entire product organization will focus on to get there.

#### The Diagnostic Layer (The "Where"): The AARRR Framework

The middle layer is the domain of the AARRR framework. It answers the critical question: "Where in the customer journey is our biggest problem or opportunity?" By analyzing the conversion rates between the five stages of the AARRR funnel, teams can perform a high-level diagnosis of the product's health. For example, a team might discover they have excellent Acquisition but a terrible Activation rate, indicating a "leaky bucket" at the top of the funnel. AARRR tells them where to focus their attention.

#### The Solution Layer (The "Why" and "How"): The HEART Framework

At the base of the pyramid is the HEART framework. Once AARRR has identified where the problem lies, HEART is used to understand why it's happening and how to fix it. It provides the granular, user-centric metrics needed to guide and validate solutions for the specific problem area. If the AARRR analysis points to a low Activation rate, the team applies HEART to the onboarding experience to diagnose and improve it.

### A Practical Example of the Unified System

Let's illustrate how these layers work together in a real-world scenario for a B2B SaaS company:

* **Layer 1 (Strategy - NSM):** The company's **North Star Metric** is *"Weekly Active Accounts."* A key Level 1 input metric in their tree is *"New Account Activation Rate."* The entire company is aligned on driving this NSM.
* **Layer 2 (Diagnostics - AARRR):** The growth team analyzes their **AARRR funnel** and discovers a significant drop-off between the Acquisition stage (trial signups) and the Activation stage (users performing a key action). Their Activation rate is only 15%, far below their target. AARRR has successfully identified *where* the problem is: onboarding.
* **Layer 3 (Solution - HEART):** The product team responsible for onboarding now uses the **HEART framework** to tackle this specific problem.
  * They set a **Task Success** goal: "Users should be able to set up their first data integration within 5 minutes."
  * They set a **Happiness** goal: "Users should feel confident and empowered after completing the onboarding flow."
  * They define **Metrics** to track these goals: *Time-to-complete-integration* and *post-onboarding NPS/CSAT score*.
  * They use these HEART metrics to guide a series of design changes and A/B tests on the onboarding flow. As they successfully improve the HEART metrics (e.g., reducing time-to-complete and increasing NPS), they observe a corresponding increase in their AARRR Activation Rate. This, in turn, contributes to the "New Account Activation Rate" input metric, which ultimately drives the company's North Star Metric.

This integrated approach creates a clear, logical chain from the highest-level strategy to the most detailed product improvements. It prevents teams from working in silos and ensures that every optimization effort is directly connected to a diagnosed problem that matters for the company's long-term growth.

::: tip Pro-Tip: The Doctor's Analogy for Frameworks
To easily remember how the frameworks fit together, use the "Doctor's Analogy":

* **North Star** is the patient's long-term health goal (e.g., "Lower cholesterol to a healthy level"). It's the ultimate outcome.
* **AARRR** is the annual physical exam. It's a broad diagnostic that identifies the general problem area (e.g., "Your blood pressure is high"). It tells you *where* to look.
* **HEART** is the specialized diagnostic tool, like an EKG or MRI. Once you know the problem is high blood pressure, you use HEART to understand the specific *why* (e.g., "Is the heart rhythm irregular? Is there a blockage?"). It guides the solution.
