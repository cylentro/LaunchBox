# Glossary of Terms

A comprehensive glossary of key terms and concepts from the Metrics Mastery for Product Managers course.

## A

**A/B Testing**
: A method of experimentation where two versions of a webpage or app (A and B) are compared against each other to determine which one performs better. It is a primary tool for validating hypotheses with empirical evidence.

**AARRR Framework ("Pirate Metrics")**
: A model for understanding the customer lifecycle, broken down into five stages: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. It's used as a diagnostic tool to identify leaks in the customer funnel.

**Activation**
: The stage in the user journey where a user experiences the product's core value for the first time (the "Aha!" moment). It is a stronger signal of engagement than a simple sign-up.

**Acquisition**
: The stage in the user journey covering all channels through which potential customers discover and come to a product.

## C

**Counter-Metric (Guardrail Metric)**
: A metric paired with a primary success metric to monitor for unintended negative consequences. It acts as a safety check to ensure that growth in one area doesn't harm another.

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
: The total cost to acquire a new customer, often calculated per channel to measure marketing efficiency.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV / LTV)**
: The total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account over the entire duration of their relationship with the product.

## D

**Data-Driven**
: A philosophy where quantitative data and metrics are the primary, and often exclusive, arbiters of decision-making.

**Data-Informed**
: A philosophy where quantitative data is treated as one crucial input among many, including qualitative research, domain expertise, and customer feedback.

## H

**HEART Framework**
: A user-centric framework developed by Google for measuring the quality of the user experience. It is an acronym for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success.

**Hypothesis**
: A clear, testable statement that connects a specific change to an expected outcome. A strong hypothesis is the foundation of any rigorous experiment.

## I

**Input Metric**
: A specific user behavior or product lever that a team can directly influence, which is a leading indicator of an output metric. Teams focus on changing input metrics to affect the North Star Metric.

## M

**Metric Tree**
: A hierarchical decomposition of a North Star Metric into its contributing input metrics. It visually connects the high-level strategic output to the granular inputs that product teams can directly influence.

## N

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
: A survey-based metric that measures a user's willingness to recommend a product, calculated on a scale from -100 to 100. It is a common measure of customer loyalty and happiness.

**North Star Framework**
: A model for managing products by focusing the entire company on a single, critical metric—the North Star Metric (NSM)—that represents the core value delivered to customers.

**North Star Metric (NSM)**
: The one measurement that best captures the intersection of customer value and business impact. It is a leading indicator of sustainable business success.

## O

**Output Metric**
: A result or scoreboard metric (like the NSM) that tells you if you are winning. Output metrics cannot be directly changed; they are influenced by input metrics.

## R

**Retention**
: The stage in the user journey that measures the ability of a product to create lasting value that encourages repeat usage.

**Referral**
: The stage in the user journey that measures the extent to which satisfied customers become advocates for the product, driving word-of-mouth growth.

**Revenue**
: The stage in the user journey where user value is converted into business value.

## S

**Statistical Significance**
: A measure used in experimentation to determine whether the observed result is likely due to the change that was made, rather than random chance.

## V

**Vanity Metric**
: A metric that looks impressive on the surface (e.g., total registered users) but fails to correlate with real business impact or meaningful engagement.
