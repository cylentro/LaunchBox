# Recommended Teaching Methodology

This course is designed for a **hands-on, project-based learning approach.** The core philosophy is "learning by doing." Each of the seven modules is intentionally structured to move quickly from concept to application, culminating in a short, practical lab exercise that reinforces the key skills. The emphasis is on building confidence and demonstrating immediate value.

Real-world case studies and examples are used throughout to ground abstract concepts in tangible outcomes, such as the data on productivity gains from regular AI use or the process for using AI in lesson planning. The teaching style should be consistently encouraging, framing challenges as learning opportunities and focusing on building a "growth mindset" toward this new and powerful technology. The goal is not just to transfer knowledge, but to foster curiosity and empower learners to continue exploring on their own.
