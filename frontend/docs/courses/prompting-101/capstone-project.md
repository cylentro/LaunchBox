# Capstone Project: Develop Your 'Personal AI Assistant Playbook'

## Objective

To synthesize all the skills learned throughout the course into a single, practical, and personalized guide that you can use in your daily work and life long after the course is over. This project is not a test of memorization, but a demonstration of your ability to apply AI concepts to solve your own unique problems.

## Project Brief

You will create a document (e.g., a Word document, Google Doc, or a collection of notes in a program like Notion) that serves as your **Personal AI Assistant Playbook**. This playbook will be your go-to resource for using AI effectively.

Your completed playbook must include the following **five sections.**

### 1. My Top 5 AI Tools.

* List at least five AI tools you explored during or after the course that you find most useful for your specific needs.
* For each tool, write a one-sentence description of what it does and why you chose it. (e.g., "Otter.ai - It automatically transcribes my work meetings so I can focus on the conversation.").

### 2. My Prompt Library.

* This is the core of your playbook. Curate a collection of at least 10 high-quality, detailed prompts that you have personally crafted and tested for recurring tasks in your work or personal life.
* Your library must include at least one clear example of a Role-Playing prompt, one Few-Shot prompt, and one Chain-of-Thought prompt.
* For each prompt, briefly note the task it accomplishes (e.g., "Prompt for drafting a weekly project update email").

### 3. My Productivity Workflow.

* Identify one specific workflow or multi-step task in your life that you have improved or partially automated using AI.
* Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing the workflow. Explain what the process was like before AI and how you use AI to make it better or faster now. (e.g., "How I use AI to summarize articles and create presentation outlines.").

### 4. My Ethics Checklist.

* Review the "AI Safety Checklist" from Module 6.
* Create your own personalized version of this checklist. You can copy the original, but try to add or modify one point to reflect the risks or considerations most relevant to your specific use cases (e.g., if you are a writer, you might add a checkpoint for "Checking for originality and unintentional plagiarism").

### 5. My Future AI Goal.

* Reflect on the future trends discussed in Module 7 (Multimodal AI and AI Agents).
* Write a short paragraph describing which of these future trends excites you the most.
* Describe one problem or complex task in your life that you hope a future AI agent or multimodal tool could solve for you, building on the ideas from the final lab exercise.
