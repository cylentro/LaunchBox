# Glossary

A quick reference for the key terms and concepts covered in this course.

## A

### Active Listening

A communication technique that involves more than just hearing words. It's the practice of showing a participant they are being heard and understood through verbal (e.g., "I see," paraphrasing) and non-verbal (e.g., nodding) cues to encourage open sharing.

### Affinity Mapping

A collaborative synthesis method used to organize qualitative data. Individual observations or quotes are written on sticky notes and then grouped into clusters based on similarity, allowing themes to emerge organically from the data.

## C

### Closed-ended Question

A question that elicits a brief, specific response, such as 'yes' or 'no', a single word, or a selection from a predefined list. Useful for confirming facts but limited in uncovering deeper insights.

### Cognitive Bias

Subconscious mental shortcuts that can influence how a researcher interprets information, potentially distorting findings. Examples include Confirmation Bias and the Framing Effect.

### Confirmation Bias

The tendency to seek out, interpret, and favor information that confirms one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. It is a significant risk in research, as it can lead teams to ignore contradictory evidence.

### Contextual Inquiry

A research method that combines observation and interviewing by studying users in their natural environment as they perform tasks. It helps uncover workarounds, environmental factors, and hidden needs that users might not mention in a traditional interview.

## E

### Empathy

In product design, a rigorous process of understanding a user's emotional state and context so deeply that it becomes a functional requirement for the product, guiding the creation of features that anticipate needs.

### Ethnography

A qualitative research method involving the researcher's deep immersion into a user's culture and environment over an extended period to gain a holistic understanding of their social dynamics, rituals, and unarticulated needs.

## F

### Funnel Approach

A structured questioning technique that organizes an interview to flow logically from broad, general topics to narrow, specific details, helping to build rapport and establish context naturally.

## I

### Informed Consent

A formal, ethical process where a participant agrees to be in a study after being fully informed of its purpose, procedures, data collection methods, risks, and their right to withdraw at any time.

### Insight

The deeper meaning or "so what?" behind an observed pattern of user behavior. An insight explains *why* a problem matters and points toward a strategic opportunity.

### Interview Guide

A structured guide, not a rigid script, that outlines the key topics and questions for an interview to ensure consistency and that all research objectives are covered.

## J

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

A framework that focuses on the "job" a user is trying to accomplish or the "progress" they are trying to make in their life. JTBD interviews deconstruct the story of a user's struggle and their decision to "hire" a product to solve it.

## L

### Leading Question

A question that subtly or overtly guides a participant toward a specific answer by embedding an assumption or desired outcome. Leading questions introduce bias and should be avoided.

## N

### Neutral Question

A question framed to be impartial and objective, avoiding any language that suggests a 'correct' or preferred response. It empowers the participant to share their genuine experience without influence.

## O

### Open-ended Question

A question designed to encourage a detailed, narrative response. Often starting with "Tell me about...", "Walk me through...", or "Why...", they are the primary engine for gathering rich qualitative insights.

## P

### Persona (User Persona)

A fictional, composite character created from research data to represent a key user segment. A good persona is built on observed behavioral patterns, goals, and frustrations, helping to ground design decisions in real user needs.

### Pilot Interview

A trial run or practice interview conducted before the actual research sessions. It is used to test the interview guide, identify flawed or confusing questions, and refine the overall flow and timing.

### Probe

A follow-up question used to dig deeper into a participant's initial response. Probes like "Why?", "Tell me more about that," or "Can you give me an example?" are used to uncover the reasoning and emotion behind a statement.

## R

### Rapport

A sense of connection and psychological safety established between the interviewer and participant. Building rapport in the first few minutes is critical for creating a comfortable, non-judgmental atmosphere where honest sharing can occur.

### Recommendation

A specific, testable hypothesis for how a product can solve a user's problem, derived from an insight. It answers the "now what?" and guides product strategy.

### Research Goals

The overarching business or product problem that the research aims to address. It defines the fundamental "why" behind the research study.

### Research Objectives

Specific, actionable statements that define precisely what information needs to be gathered during interviews to address the overarching research goal.

## S

### Screener Survey

A short questionnaire designed to filter a large pool of potential participants down to those who precisely match the target audience criteria for a research study.

### Synthesis

The structured process of transforming raw qualitative data (transcripts, notes) into organized patterns, themes, and actionable insights that can guide product strategy.

## T

### Thematic Analysis

A foundational method for qualitative data analysis that involves systematically identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within the data.

### Theme

A pattern or cluster of related observations that emerges from grouping similar data points (codes) during analysis. A theme describes *what* is happening in the data.

## U

### User Journey Map

A visualization of the process a user goes through to accomplish a goal. It maps their actions, thoughts, and feelings over time to identify moments of friction and opportunities for improvement.
