# User Persona Template

Use this template to synthesize your user interview data into a clear, evidence-backed persona. A good persona is not a collection of stereotypes; it is a data-driven archetype that represents a key user segment, helping your team build empathy and make user-centered decisions.

::: tip How to Use This Template
Fill in each section with patterns and direct quotes from your interview transcripts. This persona should be a composite character representing a cluster of similar behaviors and motivations you observed across multiple participants.
