# Convo 3: The Art of the Question - Crafting Probes That Uncover Truth

## The Question-Crafter's Toolkit

The question is the fundamental tool of the user interviewer. The way a question is framed can be the difference between a shallow, misleading answer and a deep, truthful story. Mastering the craft of questioning requires understanding the distinct roles of different question types and deploying them strategically. A well-designed interview guide is not merely a list of things to ask; it is a carefully constructed conversational arc designed to guide the participant from general context to specific, meaningful insights.

### Open-ended vs. Closed-ended Questions

The most basic, yet most critical, distinction in questioning is between open-ended and closed-ended questions. Each serves a different purpose, and a skilled interviewer knows when to use each.

#### Closed-ended questions

Elicit a brief, specific response, often a single word or a selection from predefined options. They are useful for gathering specific, quantifiable facts or confirming information.

* **Examples:** *"Do you use our mobile app?"*, *"Is price the most important factor for you?"*, *"How many times did you use the search feature last week?"*
  * **Pros:** They are quick to answer and produce data that is easy to quantify.
  * **Cons:** They shut down conversation and fail to uncover the "why" behind an answer. Overusing them can make an interview feel like an interrogation and yield very little qualitative richness.

#### Open-ended questions

Encourage detailed, expansive responses that go beyond a simple 'yes' or 'no'. They often begin with words like "Tell me about...", "Walk me through...", "How...", "What...", or "Why...". They invite the user to tell a story in their own words.

* **Examples:** *"Tell me about your process for managing client invoices."*, *"What are some of the things you consider when deciding to purchase a new gadget?"*, *"Walk me through the last time you tried to find something on our website."*
  * **Pros:** They elicit rich, detailed stories and uncover motivations, pain points, and context that closed questions cannot. They are the primary engine of qualitative insight.
  * **Cons:** The responses can be long and sometimes unfocused, requiring more effort from both the participant to answer and the researcher to analyze.

::: info Strategic Use
A common and effective pattern is to use a closed-ended question to establish a fact, followed immediately by an open-ended question to explore the context behind it. For example: *"Did you use the search feature on your last visit? (Closed)... Can you tell me more about what you were trying to find? (Open)"*

### Leading vs. Neutral Questions

The integrity of your research data hinges on neutrality. A leading question is one that subtly (or not so subtly) suggests a desired answer, planting a bias in the participant's mind. Participants, often wanting to be helpful or agreeable, will tend to conform to the suggested answer, providing socially desirable but false information.

#### Leading Questions

Subtly (or overtly) guide the participant toward a specific answer, often by embedding an assumption or a desired outcome within the question itself.

* **Bad Example:** *"Wouldn't this new feature make your workflow so much faster?"* (This question doesn't ask, it tells. The participant is socially pressured to agree).
* **Bad Example:** *"Was the onboarding process confusing for you?"* (This primes the participant to look for and focus on confusion, even if their overall experience was neutral or positive).

#### Neutral Questions

Are framed to be impartial and objective, avoiding any language that might suggest a 'correct' or preferred response. They empower the participant to share their genuine experience without influence.

* **Good Example:** *"How, if at all, does this feature impact your workflow?"* (This allows for positive, negative, or neutral responses).
* **Good Example:** *"What was your experience like with the onboarding process?"* (This invites the user to describe their experience in their own terms, whether it was confusing, easy, or something else entirely).

To avoid bias, every question in an interview guide should be reviewed with a simple test: "Does this question suggest a 'right' answer or presuppose a certain experience?" If so, it must be rephrased to be neutral.

::: tip Pro-Tip: The "Newspaper Headline" Test
Before asking a question, imagine it as a newspaper headline. Does it already imply a conclusion or a desired answer? If so, rephrase it. For example, instead of "Is our new feature amazing?", try "What was your experience using the new feature?"

### The Funnel Approach in Action

The Funnel Approach is a structured questioning technique that organizes an interview to flow logically from broad, general topics to narrow, specific details. This method is effective because it mirrors a natural conversational pattern, easing the participant into the interview before diving into more granular topics. It helps build rapport and ensures that specific questions are asked with the proper context already established.Here is an annotated script demonstrating the Funnel Approach for our **Freenancer** banking app interview with a freelance creative:

1. **Broad/Opening Questions (Top of the Funnel):** The goal here is to build rapport and understand the user's high-level context. These questions are general and non-threatening.
   * **Interviewer:** *"To start, could you tell me a little bit about your role as a freelance creative and what a typical month looks like for you?"*
   * **Purpose:** This opens the conversation broadly and allows the participant to talk about what's important to them. It establishes their professional context.
2. **Deeper/Specific Questions (Middle of the Funnel):** The interviewer now narrows the focus to a specific area of interest that emerged from the opening discussion.
   * **Interviewer:** *"That's really helpful, thank you. You mentioned that handling invoicing is a big part of your month. Could you walk me through the last time you sent an invoice to a client, starting from when you finished the project?"*
   * **Purpose:** This question transitions from a general topic ("a typical month") to a specific, behavioral story ("the last time..."). It grounds the conversation in a real memory.
3. **Probing/Follow-up Questions (Tip of the Funnel):** When the user mentions something interesting or emotional, the interviewer uses probes to dig for the "why."
   * **Participant:** "...and then I have to check my bank account every few days to see if they've paid, which is always a bit of a hassle."
   * **Interviewer:** *"You said that part was 'a bit of a hassle.' What was so hassling about it?"*
   * **Purpose:** This probe focuses on the emotional word ("hassle") to uncover the specific pain point. The hassle might be the time it takes, the anxiety of not knowing, or the awkwardness of sending a reminder.
4. **Specific Feature-related Questions (Introducing a Concept):** Only after deeply understanding the problem and context can the interviewer introduce a potential solution.
   * **Interviewer:** *"Thank you for walking me through that. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, I'm going to show you a concept for a feature. Thinking about the hassle you just described with checking for payments, how might something like this fit into that process, if at all?"*
   * **Purpose:** This question connects the proposed solution directly to the user's previously stated pain point. The phrase "if at all" reinforces neutrality, giving the participant explicit permission to say it's not useful.

This structured funnel ensures the conversation is both productive and feels natural, guiding the participant to share rich, contextual, and truthful insights.

## The Power of the Probe: The Follow-up Toolkit

The most valuable insights in a user interview are rarely given in the first answer. They are unearthed by the follow-up questions—the probes—that an interviewer uses to explore a user's initial response. A prepared interview guide gets the conversation started, but it is the skillful use of probes that turns a simple interview into a deep, exploratory session. These follow-up questions are the tools for digging beneath the surface of what a user says to understand what they truly mean, think, and feel.An expert interviewer's toolkit contains a set of simple, yet powerful, probes that can be deployed when a user says something noteworthy, emotional, or ambiguous.

### The "Why" Probe

This is the most direct and often most powerful probe in the toolkit. It asks the user to articulate the reasoning or motivation behind a behavior or statement. It should be used thoughtfully to avoid sounding accusatory, but when used correctly, it can unlock the core of a user's mental model.

* **User:** *"I always export the data to a spreadsheet to do my analysis."*
* **Interviewer:** *"That's interesting. Why do you do it that way?"*
* **Potential Insight:** The user might reveal that they don't trust the in-app analytics, that they need to combine the data with another source, or that they simply don't know how to use the built-in reporting tools. Each "why" reveals a different problem and a different opportunity.

### The "Tell Me More" Probe

This is a gentle, open-ended invitation for the user to elaborate on a topic. It is less direct than "why" and gives the user more control over where they take the conversation. It is an excellent way to encourage a user to expand on a point without leading them.

* **User:** *"The new dashboard is a bit overwhelming."*
* **Interviewer:** *"Could you tell me more about that?"*
* **Potential Insight:** The user might go on to explain that it's the number of widgets, the color scheme, or the unfamiliar terminology that feels overwhelming. This probe helps turn a vague feeling into specific, actionable feedback.

### The "Example" Probe

This probe is essential for grounding abstract statements or generalizations in concrete reality. Users often speak in generalities, but design decisions must be based on specific use cases. Asking for an example forces the user to recall a real event, which is always richer in detail than an abstract opinion.

* **User:** *"The customer support process is usually pretty slow."*
  ::: tip Pro-Tip: The "Show Me" Imperative
  Whenever a user makes a general statement about a process or a problem, immediately follow up with an "Example" or "Last Time" probe. This shifts the conversation from abstract opinions to concrete behaviors, which are far more reliable and insightful.
  :::
* **Interviewer:** *"Could you give me an example of a time you found it to be slow?"*
* **Potential Insight:** The user's story might reveal that the "slowness" wasn't the agent's response time, but the time it took to find the support contact information in the first place, or the number of times they were transferred between departments. The example pinpoints the *actual* source of the friction.

### The "Last Time" Probe

This is arguably the most effective technique for accessing true user behavior rather than idealized self-perception. People are often unreliable when asked what they "usually" do, but they are much more accurate when asked to recount a specific, recent event. This probe is the cornerstone of behavioral interviewing.

* **User:** *"I'm very organized. I file all my digital receipts for tax purposes."*
* **Interviewer:** *"That's great. Could you walk me through the last time you received a digital receipt and what you did with it?"*
* **Potential Insight:** The user's step-by-step recall might reveal a much messier reality: the receipt sat in their inbox for two weeks, they forgot about it, then they spent ten minutes searching for it before saving it to a random folder on their desktop. This story reveals a clear opportunity for a tool that automates receipt capture and organization, a need that would have been missed by taking their initial, idealized statement at face value.

By mastering this toolkit of probes, an interviewer can move beyond simply recording answers and become an active explorer of the user's world, consistently uncovering the deep insights that lead to great products.
