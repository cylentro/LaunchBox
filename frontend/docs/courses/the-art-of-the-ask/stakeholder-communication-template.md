# Stakeholder Communication Templates

The value of your research is measured by the action it inspires. A one-size-fits-all report is rarely effective. Use these templates to translate your findings into the specific language that resonates with each key stakeholder group, turning your insights into a prioritized plan of action.

## Presenting to Executives

* **Their Priority:** Business impact, strategic alignment, risk, and Return on Investment (ROI).
* **Your Goal:** Get straight to the "so what" and connect your findings to the bottom line.

### Executive Summary Template

> Our research on **`[Topic of Research]`** revealed a key insight: **`[State the core user insight in one sentence]`**.
>
> This is directly impacting our **`[Key Business Metric, e.g., revenue, retention]`**, costing us an estimated **`[Quantifiable Loss, e.g., $50,000]`** per **`[Timeframe, e.g., month]`**.
>
> We recommend **`[Actionable Recommendation]`**, which we project will result in **`[Quantifiable Gain, e.g., a 10% increase in conversion]`** and strengthen our position against **`[Key Competitor or Market Trend]`**.

## Presenting to Engineers

* **Their Priority:** Clarity, feasibility, and well-defined, actionable problem statements.
* **Your Goal:** Avoid UX jargon and frame the problem logically so they can start thinking about a solution.

### Engineering Problem Statement Template

> Users consistently fail to **`[Perform a Key Action, e.g., see the 'Save' button]`** because their mental model, based on **`[Other Applications or Patterns]`**, expects **`[Expected Behavior, e.g., the button to be in the top-right header]`**.
>
> Our current implementation, however, **`[Describe the Actual Behavior, e.g., places the button at the bottom of a long scroll]`**.
>
> This mismatch violates their expectation and causes them to **`[Describe the User Problem, e.g., believe their work is not being saved]`**.
>
> The problem to solve is: how can we align our **`[Feature Name]`** with established user patterns to eliminate this friction?

## Presenting to Designers

* **Their Priority:** The user's emotional journey, motivations, and mental models.
* **Your Goal:** Build deep empathy by telling the user's story and focusing on how it *feels* to be them.

### Design-Focused Insight Template

> During our interviews with **`[Persona Name, e.g., Anisa the Illustrator]`**, we observed a powerful moment of **`[Emotion, e.g., frustration]`**.
>
> As you can see in this video clip, when they tried to **`[Perform an Action, e.g., find the filter option]`**, they said, **`[Insert a Powerful User Quote, e.g., "I feel so stupid, I just can't find it."]`**.
>
> This feeling of **`[Negative Emotion, e.g., incompetence]`** is what we need to design for. Her goal is to feel **`[Desired Positive Emotion, e.g., empowered]`**, but our current design makes her feel the opposite.
>
> Our opportunity is to transform this moment of friction into one of delight and confidence.

::: tip The Translator's Mindset
Remember, your role is to be a translator. You translate a user's messy reality into a clear story, and then you translate that story into the specific language that motivates each stakeholder to act. Master this, and you'll move from simply gathering insights to driving real product impact.
