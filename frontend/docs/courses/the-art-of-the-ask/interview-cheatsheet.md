## Phase 1: Planning & Recruitment

| ✅ Do                                                                                                                  | ❌ Don't                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start with clear goals.** Know what decisions the research will inform.                                        | **Start by writing questions.** Without a clear goal, your questions will be unfocused.                           |
| **Use a behavioral screener survey.** Filter for your target audience with neutral questions about past actions. | **Talk to the wrong people.** Flawed recruitment guarantees flawed insights.                                      |
| **Pilot your interview guide.** Do a trial run with a colleague to find and fix confusing or leading questions.  | **Skip the pilot interview.** Going in cold is a recipe for discovering flawed questions with a real participant. |

## Phase 2: Crafting Questions

| ✅ Do                                                                                                                    | ❌ Don't                                                                                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ask open-ended questions.** Start with "Tell me about...", "Walk me through...", "Why...".                       | **Ask closed-ended questions.** "Yes/No" answers kill conversation and hide the "why."                          |
| **Ask about past behavior.** "Tell me about the last time you..." is your most powerful tool for uncovering truth. | **Ask about future intentions.** Don't ask "Would you use...?" People are bad at predicting their own behavior. |
| **Maintain strict neutrality.** Ask "What was your experience with...?"                                            | **Ask leading questions.** Avoid "Wasn't that feature easy to use?" as it suggests the "right" answer.          |
| **Ask about problems.** Focus on the user's struggles and workarounds.                                             | **Ask for solutions.** Users are experts in their problems, not in designing your product.                      |

## Phase 3: Conducting the Interview

| ✅ Do                                                                                                              | ❌ Don't                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Master the first 5 minutes.** Your primary goal is to build rapport and create psychological safety.       | **Jump straight into questions.** A cold start makes the participant feel like a test subject. |
| **Embrace the awkward pause.** When a user finishes speaking, wait a few seconds. They will often elaborate. | **Fill every moment of silence.** You'll talk over the most valuable, unprompted insights.     |
| **Thank users for negative feedback.** Treat criticism as a gift. Ask "Tell me more about that."             | **Get defensive.** Correcting or defending the design signals that honesty is unwelcome.       |
| **Paraphrase to confirm understanding.** "So, if I'm hearing you right..." ensures your data is accurate.    | **Assume you understand.** Misinterpreting a user's meaning can lead you down the wrong path.  |

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Reporting

| ✅ Do                                                                                                                            | ❌ Don't                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use thematic analysis.** Find patterns by grouping raw observations into themes.                                         | **Just list quotes.** A collection of anecdotes is not an insight.                             |
| **Tell a story with the data.** Use personas and journey maps to build empathy and highlight pain points.                  | **Deliver a dry, text-heavy report.** Your findings will be ignored if they aren't compelling. |
| **Focus on the "why."** An insight explains why a theme matters and points to a strategic opportunity.                     | **Stop at the "what."** Simply describing what users did is observation, not synthesis.        |
| **Tailor your report to the audience.** Translate insights into business impact for execs and user friction for designers. | **Use a one-size-fits-all report.** Different stakeholders care about different things.        |
