| Pitfall                            | The Trap (What it looks like)                                                                                                                                                   | Why It's Dangerous                                                                                                                                                      | The Solution (How to Avoid It)                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Confirmation Bias**        | You enter research to*prove* your great idea is right. You ask leading questions ("Isn't this feature great?") and ignore feedback that contradicts your beliefs.             | You create a false positive, leading the team to confidently build a product that nobody actually wants. It's the most common cause of product failure.                 | **Seek to be proven wrong.** Actively look for disconfirming evidence. Ask neutral, behavioral questions ("Tell me about the last time you..."). The goal is to find the truth, not to validate your ego. |
| **Flawed Recruitment**       | To save time or money, you interview people who are easy to find but don't match your target audience (e.g., interviewing casual mobile users for a professional desktop tool). | Your insights are completely irrelevant to your product strategy. You end up building features for the wrong audience, wasting months of design and engineering effort. | **Recruitment is non-negotiable.** The quality of your insights is capped by the quality of your participants. Invest in a rigorous screener survey and the right channels to find your actual users.     |
| **Misinterpreting Behavior** | A user is quiet or gives short answers, so you label them as "unhelpful." Or, a user*says* they are organized, and you take their statement at face value.                    | You miss the real insight. Silence can mean a user can't articulate their complex, messy workflow. A user's self-perception is often idealized and not their reality.   | **Observe, don't just listen.** When a user is stuck, ask them to "show me, don't tell me." Ask for specific stories about the "last time" they did something. Behavior is the ground truth.              |
