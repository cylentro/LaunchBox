# Glossary of GTM Terms

A comprehensive glossary of key terms and frameworks used throughout the Product Launch Mastery course.

## A

**ACAF Feedback Loop**
: A four-step framework for operationalizing customer feedback: **A**sk, **C**ategorize, **A**ct, and **F**ollow-up. It ensures feedback is systematically collected, analyzed, and acted upon.

**After-Action Review (AAR)**
: An internal feedback loop for the GTM team, held post-launch to debrief and learn from the process. It answers four key questions: What did we expect to happen? What actually happened? What went well and why? What can we improve?

## B

**Buyer Persona**
: A semi-fictional representation of the ideal *people* within an ICP company who are involved in the purchase decision. It details their goals, motivations, and pain points to tailor messaging.

## C

**Classic Story Arc**
: A five-act narrative structure used to map the customer's journey: Exposition (the "before" state), Inciting Incident (the trigger), Rising Action (the journey), Climax (the "Aha!" moment), and Resolution (the "after" state).

**Customer Support Enablement**
: The process of proactively preparing the customer support team for a launch with training, internal FAQs, and clear escalation paths to handle customer inquiries effectively.

## G

**Go-to-Market (GTM) Brief**
: The master strategy document for a launch. It synthesizes the target audience, problem, positioning, messaging, pricing, and channel plan into a single, shareable artifact for all stakeholders.

**Go-to-Market (GTM) Engine**
: The modern evolution of a GTM strategy from a static plan into a dynamic, continuously learning system powered by feedback loops, Product-Led Growth (PLG), and AI.

**Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy**
: A comprehensive, holistic plan for launching a product or entering a new market. It encompasses marketing, sales, pricing, distribution, and support to achieve specific business goals.

**Golden Circle**
: A framework by Simon Sinek used to define a product's core story by starting from the inside out: **Why** (the purpose), **How** (the unique process), and **What** (the features).

## H

**Hero**
: The central character in a product narrative, which is *always* the customer. The story revolves around their journey, goals, and transformation.

## I

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**
: A detailed, data-backed description of the perfect-fit *company* (for B2B) or demographic group (for B2C) that derives the most value from a product. It is the bullseye for all targeting efforts.

## M

**Magic Weapon**
: The role of your product or feature in the product narrative. It is the tool that empowers the Hero (the customer) to defeat the Villain (their problem).

**Messaging House**
: A hierarchical framework that serves as the single source of truth for all launch communications. It consists of the **Roof** (the core message), the **Pillars** (3-4 key benefits), and the **Foundation** (features and proof points).

## P

**POEM Framework**
: A model for structuring a balanced channel strategy across **P**aid Media (e.g., ads), **O**wned Media (e.g., website, blog), and **E**arned Media (e.g., press, reviews).

**Positioning Statement**
: A concise statement that articulates a product's unique place in the market relative to alternatives, typically following the format: "For [target customer] who [has a need], our [product] is a [category] that [provides a benefit]. Unlike [competitor], we [differentiator]."

## R

**RACI Framework**
: A responsibility assignment matrix used to clarify roles and eliminate confusion in a project. It defines who is **R**esponsible (the doer), **A**ccountable (the owner), **C**onsulted (provides input), and **I**nformed (kept up-to-date).

## S

**Sales Enablement**
: The process of equipping the sales team with the materials (e.g., playbooks, battlecards), training, and knowledge needed to sell a new product effectively.

**Sales Motion**
: The specific process by which a product is sold. Common motions include Self-Serve (Product-Led Growth), Inside Sales, Field Sales (Enterprise), and Channel Partners.

**"So What?" Method**
: A technique for translating product features into customer benefits by repeatedly asking "So what?" until a core human or business value is reached.

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
: The realistic slice of the SAM that a company can capture in the near term, considering its resources and competition. This is the most critical market sizing metric for setting near-term goals.

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**
: The portion of the TAM that a company's products and business model can realistically serve, constrained by factors like geography or industry focus.

**Story Before Strategy**
: The golden rule of product launches: establish the core narrative (the "Why") *before* defining the tactical GTM plan. The story acts as a strategic filter for all decisions.

## T

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
: The total worldwide demand for a product or service, representing the maximum possible revenue opportunity.

## V

**Value Proposition Canvas**
: A strategic tool that ensures a product's features are aligned with customer needs. It maps the **Customer Profile** (Jobs, Pains, Gains) to the **Value Map** (Products, Pain Relievers, Gain Creators).

**Value-Based Pricing**
: A pricing strategy where the price is determined by the perceived economic value the product delivers to the customer, rather than by cost or competitor prices.

**Villain**
: The tangible enemy in the product narrative that the Hero (customer) is fighting. It is the personification of the customer's problem or frustration (e.g., "The Spreadsheet of Doom").
