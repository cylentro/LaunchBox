# Variant 10: Tips, Tricks, and Common Pitfalls

Building a successful experimentation program involves adopting a set of best practices while diligently avoiding common traps that can invalidate results and undermine the value of testing.

## Best Practices for High-Impact Testing

* **Test One Big Idea at a Time:** In a standard A/B test, it is crucial to isolate a single variable. This means changing only one core element—such as the headline, the main image, or the call-to-action button text—in your variation. If you change multiple elements at once, you will be unable to determine which specific change was responsible for the resulting performance uplift or decline. This disciplined approach is what separates A/B testing from the more complex Multivariate Testing (MVT).
* **Run Tests for Full Weekly Cycles:** User behavior is not uniform throughout the week. A customer's browsing habits on a Monday morning at work are likely very different from their habits on a Saturday evening at home. To avoid biasing your results with these natural fluctuations, always run experiments for full weekly cycles. For example, a test started on a Tuesday should run until at least the following Tuesday to capture a complete and representative sample of user behavior.
* **Document Everything:** Creating and maintaining a central repository of all experiments is a practice that pays enormous dividends. This knowledge base should be the single source of truth for your experimentation program, accessible to all relevant team members.

::: tip Pro-Tip: A "Big Idea" is a Big Assumption
A "big idea" isn't about the size of the design change; it's about the size of the assumption you're testing. A tiny copy change that tests a core user motivation (e.g., "security" vs. "convenience") is a bigger idea than a massive redesign that isn't based on any specific insight. Always ask: what fundamental belief about our users are we challenging with this test?

::: tip Pro-Tip: Mind the Calendar
Be mindful of business cycles beyond just the week. If you're an e-commerce site, running a test during Black Friday will give you skewed results. Plan your testing calendar to avoid major holidays, marketing campaigns, or other unusual events that could contaminate your data. If you can't avoid them, be prepared to segment those users out of your analysis.

* **Document Everything:** Creating and maintaining a central repository of all experiments is a practice that pays enormous dividends. This knowledge base should be the single source of truth for your experimentation program, accessible to all relevant team members.
  * **What to Document:** For each test, record the original hypothesis, screenshots or descriptions of the control and variation(s), the primary and secondary metrics, the final results (including confidence levels and uplift), and, most importantly, the key learnings and next steps.
  * **Why It's a Superpower:** Rigorous documentation builds invaluable institutional knowledge. It prevents different teams from unknowingly repeating failed tests, helps new team members get up to speed on what has been learned about your specific audience, and creates a foundation of insights that makes future hypotheses smarter and more likely to succeed.
* **Share Learnings, Not Just Wins:** To build a true culture of experimentation, it is vital to shift the focus from "winning" to "learning." Inconclusive results and "failed" tests (where the control wins) should be shared openly and celebrated as valuable insights that prevented a bad decision or saved resources. When teams are not afraid of being wrong, they are more likely to propose bolder, more innovative, and potentially transformative test ideas.

::: tip Pro-Tip: Make Documentation Frictionless
Lower the friction of documentation by creating a simple, standardized template for every test report. Use a tool like Notion or Confluence with pre-built fields for the hypothesis, metrics, screenshots, and learnings. When it's easy to do, it's more likely to get done. The goal is a searchable brain, not a bureaucratic chore.

::: tip Pro-Tip: Create a Learning Channel
To make learning visible and celebrated, establish a simple, highly-visible ritual. Create a dedicated Slack channel like `#experimentation-learnings`. When a test concludes, post a one-paragraph summary: what you tested, what you learned about your users (especially if you were wrong!), and a link to the full report. This makes learning ambient and part of the daily company conversation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Navigating the world of A/B testing means being aware of several common pitfalls that can easily lead to flawed conclusions. Understanding these traps is the first step to avoiding them.

| Pitfall                                      | Why It's Bad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | How to Avoid It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"Peeking" at Results**               | Stopping a test the moment it reaches statistical significance or appears to be winning. This is the most common and dangerous mistake, as it capitalizes on early random fluctuations and dramatically increases the rate of false positives.        | Before launching the test, use a sample size calculator to determine the required number of visitors and a reasonable test duration. Commit to letting the experiment run its full, pre-determined course without stopping it early.                    |
| **Ignoring Statistical Significance**  | Making a business decision based on a small difference in conversion rates (e.g., 5.1% vs. 5.2%) that has a low confidence level (e.g., 60%). This difference is almost certainly due to random noise, not the change itself.                         | Adhere to a strict, pre-defined significance threshold, which is typically 95% confidence (or a p-value of <0.05). Do not implement a change unless it meets this standard of evidence.                                                                 |
| **Forgetting About Guardrail Metrics** | Focusing solely on the primary metric and failing to notice that the "winning" variation is causing harm elsewhere. For example, a new feature increases engagement but significantly slows down the app's performance.                               | Always define and monitor 1-3 critical guardrail metrics alongside your primary metric. A true win improves the primary metric without negatively impacting the guardrails.                                                                             |
| **Testing Trivial Changes**            | Experimenting with minor changes, like a slightly different shade of grey for a button, on a page with very little traffic. These tests rarely produce a detectable impact and waste valuable time and resources that could be spent on bolder ideas. | Prioritize experiments based on their potential impact. Focus on significant changes to elements on high-traffic, high-value pages (e.g., homepage, pricing page, checkout funnel) where even a small percentage lift can have a major business impact. |
| **Testing Too Many Things at Once**    | In a single variation, changing the headline, the main image, the button copy, and the page layout. This is a common beginner mistake that makes it impossible to learn which specific change caused the result.                                      | In a standard A/B test, isolate and test only one core change per variation. If you need to test the interaction of multiple changes, use Multivariate Testing and ensure you have sufficient traffic to support it.                                    |

## Key Takeaways

* **Isolate Your Variables:** To get a clean, unambiguous learning, change only one core element per variation in a standard A/B test.
* **Never "Peek" at Results:** This is the most common and dangerous pitfall. Trust the sample size you calculated beforehand and let the test run its full course to avoid false positives caused by random fluctuations.
* **Run for Full Weekly Cycles:** User behavior changes throughout the week. Run tests for at least one full week (e.g., Tuesday to Tuesday) to ensure your data is representative and not biased by weekday/weekend patterns.
* **Guardrails Prevent Hidden Losses:** A "win" that harms another key metric (like user retention or page speed) is actually a net loss. Always monitor guardrail metrics.
* **Document to Compound Learning:** A well-maintained, centralized repository of all test results (wins, losses, and inconclusive) is your company's institutional memory. It prevents duplicate work and makes every future hypothesis smarter.

## Remember This Even If You Forget Everything Else

The most dangerous enemy of a valid A/B test is impatience. The urge to stop a test early the moment it looks good ("peeking") is the number one cause of false positives. Discipline is your best defense. Trust the math you did upfront, let the test run its full, pre-determined course, and you will build a program on a foundation of truth, not luck.
