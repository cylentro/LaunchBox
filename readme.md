# LaunchBox & Nait - An Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio, a project designed to showcase my work, skills, and passion for technology in a more engaging way. This repository contains two main components:

1. **LaunchBox** : The frontend of my portfolio, built with VitePress. It's a static site that houses all the content about my professional experience, projects, and tech stacks.
2. **Nait** : The AI assistant that powers the conversational experience on the site. It's a backend service built with Next.js and integrated with the Google Gemini API to answer questions about me based on the portfolio's content.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Modern Static Site** : A clean and fast portfolio website built with VitePress and styled with Tailwind CSS.
* **Conversational AI Assistant (Nait)** : Ask questions and get answers about my career, projects, and skills. Nait is designed to be a helpful guide to the portfolio.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** : Nait uses a RAG architecture to ensure its answers are grounded in the actual content of this portfolio, preventing it from making things up.
* **Detailed Content** : Features a comprehensive resume, project showcase, AI experiments, and a list of my favorite tech stacks.
